# Frontend Code Challenge

This repo is a light version of the [TheOrg](https://theorg.com) web app.

## The challenge

- Look at [the supplied Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/wiWRVlKWuY4itW89sYnhzy/Code-Challenge%3A-Splash-Page?node-id=0%3A1) üåÑ, you might need to sign up to inspect the various design elements and get CSS hints
- The challenge is to build the desgin into the web app as best as possible. The [Demo.tsx](./src/routes/demo/Demo.tsx) file can be used as a starting point.

_The challenge should not take more than 3-4 hours._

#### It's worth noting that:

- Everything can be done with the supplied files, but to make the code more readable you're very welcome to split out the layout and add additional supporting components in the [./components](./src/components) folder.
- The data for the brands is supplied via an Apollo graphql hook that can be imported as: `import { useAllBrandsQuery } from '@app/apollo/types';`.
